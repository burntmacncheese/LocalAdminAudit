# LocalAdminAudit
This is a simple Powershell script that provides the list of accounts in the local administrators group for computers in Active directory. It will save a CSV file listing computer names and members of the administrators group. I find this useful to help police admin permissions on local devices. The RSAT tools are required to use active directory.
